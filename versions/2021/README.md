# 2021 #

The 2021 datasets are created by downloading zipped shapefiles from the
[Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions](https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/senate-final-approved-errata)
zipped shapefiles and converting into GeoJSON files.

The [GeoProcessor](https://software.openwaterfoundation.org/)
and [TSTool](https://opencdss.state.co.us/tstool/)
software are used to automate the processing.
