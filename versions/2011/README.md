# 2011 #

The 2011 datasets were manually downloaded from the following sources and converted to GeoJSON using QGIS:

* [Colorado Information Marketplace - Colorado State House of Representatives District Boundaries (2011)](https://data.colorado.gov/Legislative/Colorado-State-House-of-Representatives-District-B/jf7j-4sik)
* [Colorado Information Marketplace - Colorado State Senate District Boundaries (2011)](https://data.colorado.gov/Legislative/Colorado-State-Senate-District-Boundaries-2011-/c9h8-fdgk)

Consequently, there are no workflow files for the 2011 processing.
The GeoJSON files were created in 2020.
See the [`data`](#data) folder for the 2011 data files.
